# Sales and Customer Analytics with Power Bi
This project is a comprehensive Sales and Customer Analytics Dashboard built using Microsoft Power Bi. I designed this two-part dashboard to transform raw sales and customer data into actionable business intelligence.

## üìå**Project Overview**
This portfolio project consists of two-part dashboard system created with Microsoft Power Bi to analyze a sample store‚Äôs data. My primary goal and objectives was to transform the raw dataset into some comprehensive business intelligent solutions, providing stakeholders with clear insights into both **sales performance and customers behavior**. The project was split into two dashboards: One focused on core sales metrics, and the other on customers and logistics analytics.

## **Dashboard 1: Sales Performance Dashboard**

## ‚ú®Key Features
-	**Core Business KPIS**: The dashboard prominently features key performance indicators (KPIS) including **Total Orders, Total Profit, Total Sales, and Profit Margin**, providing a quick and comprehensive look at a business financial health and state.
-	**Regional Sales Analysis**: I used a bar chart visual that shows **Total Orders by Region**, helping to identify top performing geographical areas.
-	**Profitability At a Glance**: A gauge chart is used to visualize the Total Profit, making it easy to see if the company is meeting its profits target.
-	**Categorical Performance**: I used a chart to breaks down Total Orders by Category, revealing which product categories are most popular.
-	**Historical Trends**: I used a chart that visualizes Total Sales by Year, allowing for an analysis of year- over-year sales growth and trends.

  ## üóÇÔ∏è**Dashboard 2: Customer and Logistics Analytics**

  ## Key Features
  
-	**Customer Centric Metrics**: The dashboard tracks a crucial customer and logistics metrics, including **Total Churned Customers, Customers Lifetime Value, Total Returned Customers, and Average Sales Per Order.
-	**Product and Sales Breakdown**: I created a chart to show the Sum of Quantity by Category, and another chart that visualizes the Average Sales, providing deeper insights into product performance.
-	**Geographic Churn Analysis**: I  used a chart that shows Churned Customers by City, and a separate map visual  that shows Country/Region Variation, helping to pinpoint areas with high customer attrition.

## üõ†Ô∏è**Methodology**

My methodology was grounded in a structured approach to data analysis and visualization.
1.	**Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: I began by importing the raw data into my power Bi Power Query Editor. I performed essential data cleaning tasks, including  handling missing values and ensuring data types were correct.
2.	**DAX Calculations**: I used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create all the custom measures for my KPIS, such as Total Churned Customers, Customers Lifetime Value, and Profit Margin.
3.	**Data Modeling**: I structured the data mode by creating relationships between different tables as needed, ensuring data could be accurately filtered and analyzed across my two dashboards.
4.	**Dashboard Design**: I designed two distinct dashboards, each with specific focus. The visuals where chosen carefully to best represent the data and tell a clear story for each theme (Sales Performance vs. Customer/Logistics).


## **Skill Demonstrated**

-	**Power BI**: I demonstrated an end to end skill in power BI, from loading to report publication
-	**Power Query**: I used power Query for essential data cleaning and transformation tasks, ensuring data quality and readiness for my analysis.
-	**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: I leveraged DAX to create custom measures for key metrics like Total Sales , Total Profit, Profit Margin, Customers Lifetime Value, and Total Churned Customers.
-	**Data Modelling**: I structured the data model by defining relationships between tables, which allowed for seamless filtering and analysis across multiple dashboards.
-	**Dashboard Design**:   I designed two distinct, user friendly dashboards to present complex data in a clear compelling, and actionable way.


## üìà**Key Findings**

Based on the insights from my dashboards, here are some of my key findings:
-	**Regional Performance**: Certain regions demonstrate higher sales volume and order numbers, highlighting potential for growth and further market penetration.
-	**Customer Churn Hotspots**: My analysis of churned customers by city and region reveals specific geographical areas with high customer attrition, indicating potential issues.
-	**Product Category Trends**: My analysis shows certain product categories are clear drivers of order quantity, suggesting they are very popular with customers.

## üí°**Recommendations**

Based on my analysis findings, I would recommend the following actions:
1.	**Strategic Regional focus**: There should be more allocations of resources to high performing regions to maximize sales potential and investigate reasons for low performance in other areas.
2.	 **Targeted Churn Reduction**: I suggest they should address specific issues identified in cities and regions with high churn to improve customers retention.
3.	**Product Strategy**: I suggest a focus on optimizing the supply chain and marketing efforts for the most popular categories to help in capitalizing on existing demand.
